# California Housing Price Prediction using Machine Learning

**Welcome to California Housing Price Prediction!**

Before you explore this project or encounter any issues along the way, please take a moment to read this note.

This project is part of a Data Science course at Purwadhika and serves as the author's third capstone project.

While this project is designed to predict housing prices in California using machine learning, it may not fully represent the complexity of the real-world housing market. Please consider this a learning and practice tool, rather than a production-ready application.

The data and information within this project do not exactly reflect actual housing market conditions or prices in California.

Thank you for understanding, and enjoy your experience! üè°


## Context

California, a state located in the western part of the United States, is known for its stunning coastline facing the Pacific Ocean and a population exceeding 39.2 million people, making it the most populous state in the US. This demographic diversity creates unique societal characteristics, significantly impacting housing needs and preferences.

In the housing sector, various demographic factors influence California's home prices. For example, areas with higher incomes or proximity to business centers often have higher home prices. Realtors and brokers play a crucial role in bridging the gap between buyers and sellers, requiring them to accurately price properties to meet both seller expectations and buyer budgets. Insights from California Census data are invaluable for assessing and forecasting home prices.

## Problem Statement

The diversity in California's population and its economic factors pose challenges in setting property prices. Realtors need a tool to determine the average home price based on property features and macro factors such as population, income, and location. This tool must offer precise predictions, optimizing pricing strategies, and ensuring fair prices for buyers.

## Goals

The proposed solution is to build a machine learning model that predicts average house prices in California using features from the California Census data. This tool equips realtors with a competitive edge, helping them set the right prices, build trust with clients, and maximize profits. It aids in avoiding overpricing, understanding market changes, and marketing homes effectively.

## Analytic Approach

The approach begins with a deep dive into the data to extract insights on each home's unique attributes. Subsequently, a regression model is constructed to forecast average house prices, especially when provided with new features from the California Census data.

## Evaluation Metrics

To assess the model's accuracy, three evaluation metrics are used:

1. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Measures the standard deviation of residuals, quantifying how far predictions are, on average, from actual values. Lower RMSE values indicate a better model.

2. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Calculates the average of absolute errors between predicted and actual values. Lower MAE values signify a better model.

3. **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**: Computes the average percentage error between predicted and actual values. Lower MAPE values are indicative of a better model.

By employing these evaluation metrics, the model's performance can be rigorously assessed.

This repository serves as the foundation for developing and deploying the California Housing Price Prediction model, empowering real estate professionals with accurate and data-backed insights into the housing market.
